=========================

A matlab implementation of Supervised learning algorithm

A Supervised learning algorithm which can classify multi-class problems.

Brief Description:

A random forest classifcation algorithm which used Kmeans ro perform data splits at each node ( the splits are unsupervised , and donot use labels)

Data format:

H (n*m) input matrix with n points and m features .

Labels (n*1) - Labels to corresponding data files.

Creating Train and Test datasets for multiple runs.

You can use the "supervised_bagging" function of this purpose.
(Let me know if any difficulty)

TrainDMapIndices - Indices of randomly shuffled training points. 

TrainLabels - Corresponding training labels.

TestDMapIndices - Indices of randomly shuffled testing points.

TestLabels  - Corresponding testing labels.

Other parameters in the file can be changed according to the need.

Please let me know before any major changes.

**To RUN the code:**

**The main matlab script is "cslforest_supervised.m"**
